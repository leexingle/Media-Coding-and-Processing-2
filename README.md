# Media Coding and Processing

## Tasks
- **Task 1:** Implement `extractHOGFeatures` to compute Histogram of Oriented Gradients from scratch.  
- **Task 2:** Implement `harrisCornerDetector` to detect corners in an image using the Harris method.  
- **Task 3:** Evaluate robustness of the Harris Corner Detector under image transformations.  

## Notes
- All code is written in **MATLAB** without using built-in HOG or corner detection functions.
